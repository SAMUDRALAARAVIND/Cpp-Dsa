## DSA preparation strategy

### Language( CPP )

- Variables , Operators ( including bitwise operators ) &, |, ^, >>, << .
- Pointers (single & double )
- Conditional statements & Loops ( while & for )
- Functions, call by value & call by reference.
- structures & basics of classes ( access modifiers, constructor, destructor , methods , properties )

### Data structures (CPP)

#### Complexity analysis

- Big O notation for both time & space complexity. 
- Derive logn , sqrt(n), n^2 , 2^n, n! 

#### Built in data structures (STL)

Minimum requirement: `Learn crud operations and iteration on each data structure`

- primitive 1D arrays, 2D arrays, strings.
- vector
- set
- unordered_set
- stack
- queue, dequeue
- map
- unordered_map
- priority queue ( min & max )

#### User defined data structures

- LinkedList
- Trees (Binary, Nary), segment tree, heap, AVL, BST.
- Trie
- Graph (weighted, unweighted, directed, undirected ) adjecency matrix, adjecency list.
- Disjoint set (advanced)

### Algorithms

#### Builtin algorithms (STL)

- binary_search, lower_bound, upper_bound
- sort
- reverse

#### External algorithms

#### Arrays & strings

- Sorting (bubble, insertion, quick, merge).
- Search (linear, binary).
- Dutch National flag algo
- Kadane's (1D & 2D)
- KMP
- Rabin-karp

#### Graph algorithms

- Prim's, Kruskal's and Dijkstra's
- Bellmanâ€“Ford Algorithm
- Floyd Warshall Algorithm
- Topological sorting
- Minimum spanning tree
- Articulation points

#### Techniques (solve minimum 5 problems of each type)

- Divide & Conquer.
- Sliding window (fixed length, variable length)
- Two pointer
- prefix sum & suffix sum.
- BFS, DFS (In grids, Trees, Graphs) : very important
- Recursion, Backtracking, Drawing Recursion Tree
- Dynamic Programming (Bottom up & top down )
- Connected components in graphs.
- In place reversal of Linked List.
- Cycle detection in graphs & Linked List.
